or as a [userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonDerThan/bookbuyer/main/bookbuyer.user.js).

## Settings

You can configure the settings for the search links! Just click this add-on's

## Userscript users

To configure the search site and the search settings you have to modify the

script, and modify the variables `SEARCH_SITE`, `SEARCH_PARAM`, `inclAuthor`,
and `searchParams`. See the comments for more infos.
